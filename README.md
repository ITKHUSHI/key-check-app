The project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using Angular 12+ for the frontend and Node.js/TypeScript for the backend. It includes user authentication and role-based access control.

✅ Login Page: Users can log in using UserID, Password, and Role (General User/Admin). A dummy API stores and retrieves user details using MongoDB, XML, or AWS DynamoDB.
